# ⚙️ Orynt SDK & REST API

Orynt provides developers with both a **lightweight SDK** and a **REST API** to access multiple AI models in a unified way. Payments are handled on Solana through **x402 micropayments**, allowing pay-per-request in USDC. The SDK and API are designed for **quick integration**, consistent endpoints, and easy authorization via crypto wallets.

```
    curl -X POST https://api.oryntai.xyz/api/v1/ai/images \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Network: solana" \
      -d '{
        "model": "dall-e-3",
        "prompt": "A futuristic city skyline at sunset",
        "n": 1,
