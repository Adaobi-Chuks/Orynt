# 🔍 How It Works

Here’s how Orynt powers AI model access with pay-per-request billing, multi-network support, and a unified API/SDK.

---

## 🖇️ The Big Picture

Orynt combines three core parts:

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="AI Model Access" icon="brain">
    One unified API/SDK that works with multiple providers (OpenAI, Gradient, etc.) for chat, images, embeddings, and speech.
  </Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Payment Infrastructure" icon="coins">
  The **x402 Protocol** handles pay-per-request payments using tokens (e.g.,
  USDC) across supported networks.
</Card>

  <Card title="Facilitator Layer" icon="network-wired">
    **PayAI** bridges your request via Orynt to x402, ensuring smooth payment verification and AI execution.
  </Card>
</Columns>
> You’re sending a request and paying for it at the same time, no subscriptions, no API keys.

## ⚡ Request & Payment Flow

Here’s the step-by-step process for making a paid API/SDK request:

---
### 1️⃣ Make a Request

Send a request via SDK or REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.oryntai.xyz/api/v1/ai/images" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Network: solana" \
-d '{
  "model": "dall-e-3",
  "prompt": "A futuristic city skyline at sunset",
  "n": 1,
  "width": 1024,
  "height": 1024
}'
```
---
### 2️⃣ Payment Required (HTTP 402)

If payment is required, the server responds with `402 Payment Required` and x402 instructions.

The response body follows the **x402 Protocol** specification and looks like this:

```json
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "error": "X-PAYMENT header is required",
  "accepts": [
    {
      "scheme": "exact",
      "network": "solana-devnet",
      "maxAmountRequired": "40000",
      "resource": "http://api.oryntai.xyz/api/v1/ai/images",
      "description": "Generate images",
      "mimeType": "",
      "payTo": "CEBAqJoQXomRdMubgTWL1fa99d2zr2rFTMPukk62fSUw",
      "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
      "asset": "4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU",
      "outputSchema": {
        "input": {
          "type": "http",
          "method": "POST",
          "discoverable": true
        }
      },
      "extra": {
        "feePayer": "2wKupLR9q6wXYppw8Gr2NvWxKBUqm4PPJKkQfoxHDBg4"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
This tells the client exactly **how to pay** for the request.

Key fields include:

- **`network`** — which chain to use (`solana-devnet`, `base`, `polygon`, etc.)
- **`asset`** — the token used for payment (e.g., USDC mint address)
- **`maxAmountRequired`** — the maximum amount required to fulfill the request
- **`payTo`** — wallet address to send the payment to
- **`maxTimeoutSeconds`** — how long the payment window stays valid
- **`resource`** — the specific endpoint being billed
- **`extra.feePayer`** — optional facilitator address used for covering transaction fees

---
### 3️⃣ Pay & Resend

Once you receive the `402 Payment Required` response, your client (or wallet) performs a payment on the specified network, for example, sending USDC on Solana to the `payTo` address provided.

After the transaction is confirmed, you resend the **same original request**, but now include the `X-PAYMENT` header containing the on-chain transaction signature (proof of payment).

```bash
-H "X-PAYMENT: <your_payment_signature>"
```
---
### 4️⃣ Verification & Response

If the payment proof is valid and verified by the facilitator (via **PayAI**), Orynt will process your request and return the result (e.g., an image URL).

If the payment is **invalid** or **expired**, you’ll receive another `402` response with updated payment instructions.

---
### 5️⃣ Response / Result
If payment and verification complete, you receive HTTP 200 OK along with the requested resource (text, image URL, audio, etc.).

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "created": 1763033695,
  "data": [
    {
      "revised_prompt": "A detailed image capturing the essence of a futuristic cityscape at sunset. Imagine towering skyscrapers with undulating, metallic surfaces and windows of neon gleam under the setting sun's orange and pink hues. Luminescent drones and transit tubes connecting the buildings together, implying a well-connected, advanced transportation network. Elevated gardens on terraces hinting at a harmonious coexistence of technology and nature. Reflections of the sunset stand stark against the cool fluorescence of the city, providing a striking contrast. The sky vibrates with shades of red and purple as the sun dips below the horizon.",

## 🔧 Handling Failures & Refunds
Orynt ensures reliability and fair usage across all paid requests:

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="Failed AI Request" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    If the payment is accepted but the AI endpoint fails, Orynt ensures your payment is **reverted or credited**.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Invalid Payment" icon="times-circle">
    If the payment proof is invalid, the server returns HTTP 402 with updated instructions for retrying.
